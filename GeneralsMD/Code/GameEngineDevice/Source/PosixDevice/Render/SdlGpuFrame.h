/*
** The device's frame on SDL3 GPU (decision 7, phase A3a): the SDL_GPUDevice, C2's window claimed for it,
** the offscreen back buffer and depth-stencil the engine draws into, and Present, which takes the back
** buffer to the window through D3D9's gamma ramp.  Only a device with a window has one: -headless makes
** no SDL_GPUDevice at all (phase A3's design).
**
** Nothing is issued as the engine asks for it.  Clears and draws are recorded into a batch, with a copy
** of every byte a draw reads that can still change (the staging stream) and the uploads of the GPU
** copies it needs; Flush runs the batch as one copy pass and then render passes that replay the records
** in order, a clear being the load operation of the pass after it (A3c).  Only a clear of the whole target is taken here; a clear of part of it is a clear draw.
**
** Main thread only, as every SDL GPU call is.
