// PERF1's timing aid.  ZH_GPU_TIMING="delay,count" measures the `count` frames that start `delay` seconds
// after the first Present - a stretch after loading whatever the resolution - and prints, as soon as the
// last of them is in (a run ended by a timeout still reports), the distribution of each over them:
//   - frame: the wall time from one Present to the next, everything the game did in between;
//   - draws: the draws recorded in it;
//   - device draw: the CPU time inside Gpu_Draw, recording those draws (state, programs, copies, staging);
//   - device flush: mid-frame flushes (a full batch, a read-back) recording and submitting the batch;
//   - device present: Present recording and submitting the frame's last batch, and the gamma pass,
//     including the swapchain wait;
//   - swapchain wait: SDL_WaitAndAcquireGPUSwapchainTexture's, which is the display's pacing (a hidden
//     window still waits for vsync), and work: the frame without it - what the frame costs;
//   - not paced: frames presented to a window SDL called hidden, occluded or minimised, and frames whose
//     swapchain gave no drawable.  macOS hands a hidden or occluded window drawables and does not wait for
//     vsync, so a run full of them measures the game unpaced - a -hiddenwindow run, and a MacBook Air's
//     locked session, read as 119 fps on a 60 Hz panel - and the counts say so;
//   - GPU (ZH_GPU_TIMING_SYNC=1 only): every submit waits for its fence, and the waits add up.  That
//     serialises CPU and GPU, so a SYNC run's frame times are not the game's: it measures the GPU.
// What is left of the frame after the device's parts is the engine's own CPU time (and, unsynced, any
// wait for the GPU inside SDL's swapchain acquire).
