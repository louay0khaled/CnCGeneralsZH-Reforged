# This is the POSIX half of Tools/vendor.ps1 and deliberately a second implementation rather than
# a shared one: a Python dependency costs more here than the duplication does. Behaviour, paths and
# output are meant to match vendor.ps1 line for line, so read that one too before changing this one.
#
# EA stripped these from the source release and they are not ours to commit, so every fresh clone
# has to get them once. build-posix.sh runs this before it configures; running it again when everything
# is in place costs one directory check per library and nothing else.
#
#   --force   re-fetch even what is already there
#
# What it cannot get is the game itself: the .big files from a Zero Hour install go next to the
# executable in GeneralsMD/Run, and the base game's in Run/ZH_Generals. The game says so on startup
# when they are missing.

# TARGET_OS_MAC still arrives transitively through Apple's system headers, so the typedef is
# skipped - and MacTypes.h is not what zlib.h ends up including, so nothing supplies it. Every
# translation unit then dies at zconf.h:223, "unknown type name 'Byte'".
#
# No compile definition fixes this: the guard tests defined(), so defining either name skips the
# typedef harder. The file has to change. zlib upstream reached the same conclusion and deleted the
# guard outright in 1.2.0, which is exactly what this does.

#   2. this repository's own art release on GitHub, which is where anyone who just cloned the
#      public repository gets it. art.json there lists each file with its sha256, so the hashes are
#      not pinned in this script and regenerating the art does not leave it lying.
#
# With neither, the step is skipped: the game plays at the textures it shipped with, and
# experiments/doku-upscale is where the art is made.
