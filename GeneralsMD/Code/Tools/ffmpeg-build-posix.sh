#
# Builds the FFmpeg the POSIX build links, from the tarball Tools/vendor.sh keeps in
# Libraries/Source/FFmpeg, with the components the game's movies need and nothing else (V1).
#
#   ffmpeg-build-posix.sh <tarball> <work dir> <install prefix> <C compiler> [<extra cflags>]
#
# CMake runs it (the ffmpeg_posix custom command) whenever the tarball or this script changes. It
# unpacks into <work dir>, configures and builds there, installs include/ and five static libraries
# into <install prefix>, and then deletes <work dir>: the unpacked tree is 110MB and the objects
# another 9MB, while what is kept is 3.5MB. Measured on the Mac (arm64, load ~5): configure 23s,
# make -j8 7s.
#
# What the movies need, and therefore all that is built:
#   .bik movies -> the bink demuxer, the bink video decoder and both binkaudio decoders, the file
#                  protocol, and swscale and swresample for bink_ffmpeg.cpp's conversions.
# Unlike Windows' build (Tools/ffmpeg-build.sh) there is no mp3 or wav: off Windows the game's own
# audio is decoded by miniaudio (C4), so FFmpeg serves only the movies.
#
# --disable-asm, measured over all 70 movies of the install (V1): the Bink decoder is
# bit-exact between the NEON and C builds, but swscale's NEON yuv420p->BGRA path is not the C path's
# arithmetic. With the C paths every POSIX machine converts to identical bytes, so one golden table
# serves the Mac and Linux, and nasm is not a build dependency. The cost was 141s instead of 128s to
# decode everything, 1761s of video: still 12.5x real time on one core.
#
# --disable-autodetect keeps VideoToolbox, AudioToolbox, iconv, zlib and the rest out of the link.
#
# LGPL: configure prints "License: LGPL version 2.1 or later" for this line (no --enable-gpl, no
# --enable-nonfree). The libraries are static here; the game is GPL-3 with its source published, so
# anyone can relink it against a modified FFmpeg (LGPL 2.1 section 6). COPYING.LGPLv2.1 is installed
# beside the libraries as LICENSE.txt.
