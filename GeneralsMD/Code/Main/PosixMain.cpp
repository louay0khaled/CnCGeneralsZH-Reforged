// Modified 2026 by İlyas Akın for the macOS/Linux port: parts come from GeneralsMD/Code/Main/WinMain.cpp, the rest is new code, copyright 2026 İlyas Akın; see NOTICE.md and the git history.

// FILE: PosixMain.cpp ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Desc:   The game's entry point off Windows (C2): WinMain's start-up sequence without the Windows.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/* One main for macOS and Linux, on SDL3 (decision 3).  It follows WinMain.cpp step for step, in its
	 order, and leaves out what only Windows has; each left-out step says where it goes:

	 - _set_FMA3_enable(0): the x64 C runtime's choice between two libm paths.  Whether this platform's
		 libm answers the logic's log() the same way is E1's question, not the entry point's.
	 - SetProcessDPIAware: the window's pixel density is the renderer's (D4).
	 - _set_se_translator / SetUnhandledExceptionFilter: their counterpart is C5's crash handler,
		 installCrashHandlers, first thing in main.
	 - "-DX" stack dumps: Windows symbol lookup (GetFunctionDetails).
	 - _CrtSetDbgFlag, the splash bitmap, OLE, copy protection and the Optimus exports: Windows only.
	 - The Windows window class and WndProc: the window is SdlGameEngine's, which the engine creates
		 before GameEngine::init, as WinMain creates it before GameMain.

	 The install root is the process's working directory, as on Windows, where WinMain sets it to the
	 executable's directory.  Here that is the default too, and "-root <dir>" overrides it.  It is set
	 once, before anything asks for a path, and nothing changes it after (C1's Roots paragraph).  Port
	 rule 9 (PORTING.md) applies to how this is RUN: GameEngine::init deletes Data\INI\INIZH.big from the root, as it
	 does in a player's install, so a development run must be rooted at a copy of the game data.
	 The fork's own data is an overlay searched before that root (P1, decision 9): "-overlay <dir>", or
	 the one a package puts beside the executable.  See chooseOverlays.  Since P1 step 2 every root is
	 read-only: a relative write, that deletion included, is refused and logged, so rule 9 holds by
	 construction as well as by how the game is run. */
